# Lumifox chess engine

## Overview

Lumifox is my personal attempt at creating a chess engine, for, the 50th time. It will be written in Rust, as well as, depending on the later features, C++, or whatever Vulkan or OpenCL does use.

More information about the engine will be added when, and if, I get to it, sorry I just don't have anything to say right now.
